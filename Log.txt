This file will include information about the progress of the project and meeting summaries.

** Meeting Summaries **
1. Jan - 30 - 2023
  The meeting took about 1hour and 30 mintues. In this meeting we give a quick demo of GitHub functionalities and version control for everyone to be on the same page. Furthermore, we setup the a working initial project for everyone so that everyone is on the same page and to avoid later confusions. We then gathered all ideas about and explored a few ways we could start our project. At the end of the meeting, we broke down the first big user story which is about Create Reservation into sevelar developer tasks where each team member bid for the tasks and setup a dealine for the tasks.

2. February 6, 2023 

This meeting lasted for about 35 minutes. In this meeting we took a look at what progress has been made so far in our project. For example, we have implemented the GUI that will satisfy a requirement of our big user story "Create Reservations". Additionally we implemented a stub that uses a non-persistent storage such as an Array list. Furthermore we took a look at the code we currently have have and found there is a couple of design patterns that we can utilize such as the builder pattern, and decorator pattern. Lastly at the end of the meeting we found that the pace we are working at is consistent with the cost that we defined in our vision statement, and we assigned each team member additional tasks that needs to be done before the Iteration 1 Deadline.

This was the group's final meeting prior to Itr1 submission. The team was updated on what has been accomplished so far and what is remaining for Itr1 requirements. 

Complete: 
   - Functioning MVP
   - UML class diagrams

In-progress/to-be-completed:
   - Wiki
   - Sketch of overall architecture
   - Class diagram report

The meeting was concluded with a quick demo of our MVP.

4. February 16, 2023

This meeting lasted approximately 30 minutes, and during this meeting we had the opportunity to meet with our client team (group 7) to provide some feedback on our current implementation and to provide additional user stories we can implement that are within the scope of our project. one feature they requested for us to implement is to display
the credit card information whenever you pull up a reservation but do it in a way where we hide sensitive information such as the entire credit card number. For example instead of displaying credit card # 1234 5678 9123 4567, we should display it like 1234 **** **** 4567. Additionally another user story that the client team wants us to implement is to provide handicapped accessible rooms which will be well suited for guests with special accessibility needs and additional assistance. Lastly our client team requested a user story where we can remove a created reservation, however that has been already discussed by our development team and has been scheduled to be implemented in Iteration 2. 

=========================================================================================

5. February 16, 2023 (13:00-13:15)
  
  - We met with our dev team (team 5) to discuss what we would like them to add to their planned implementations.
  
  - Presented user story A: As a user, I want to be able to search by course name, not just course code. 

  - Presented user story B: As a user, I want to be able to see previous courses I have taken and the resources that I uploaded for those courses.

  - Client team chose user story A.

6. February 20, 2023 

This meeting lasted approximately 20 minutes, and during this meeting we took a look at what are the requirements of Iteration 2. 
We decided to divide some of the tasks that need to be done.

Miguel and Humud - Setup Database 

James and Dexter - work on the back end and front end of authorizing and authentication users logging on to the system.

=========================================================================================

7. Mar. 1, 2023 (19:00-19:30)

- The team went over the feedback from Itr1 and discussed further who is responsible for which tasks for Itr2. 
- From Itr1, everyone needs to review their code and add proper comments. 
- From Itr1, input fields (e.g., phone number, credit card) needs proper restrictions on what data type can be entered. (Dexter)
- From Itr1, break up long methods into smaller, more focused methods (e.g., CreateReservationFrame Class & UpdateFrame Class). (Dexter)
- New user story: hide middle part of credit card information once entered. Either in this iteration or next, a button or way to reveal and hide the 
  X's will be a nice feature. (Dexter)
- For Itr2, database implementation (Miguel & Humud)
- For Itr2, additional user story - user authentication (James)

=========================================================================================

8. March 7, 2023  (11:30 - 12:00)

- During this meeting we took a look at what we completed since our last meeting, and what else needs to be done to prepare for submission 

- everyone needs to continue reviewing their code and to add comments as well as refractoring.

- include modified planning document

- Add J unit tests for the methods we have implemented. 

=========================================================================================

9. March 21, 2023 (19:00 - 20:30)

- Each group member showed and explained what they were working on for Iteration 3.
     - Humud --> Employee front-end for staff to see their employee profiles and pay information.
     - Dexter --> A frame for employees to select while logging in, whether they want to view their employment information or go to the interface 
       to perform their duties.
     - Miguel --> Addressing bugs from QA team and working on database.
     - James --> Housekeeping front-end to search/filter desired rooms and the ability to change the room status (dirty, clean, inspected). 

- This week's goal is to complete the back-end implementation for each group member's respective front-end - Sunday deadline.

- Next week, the team will work on the Front Desk user stories (e.g., check-in/check-out, billing).
